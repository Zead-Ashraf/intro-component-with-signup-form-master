#Intro component with sign up form
## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is a simple sign-up form, which helps you to fill it correctly,
1. it helps you find the un-filled inputs.
2. it helps you find what is wrong in your gmail.
  1. check if it has a (username).
  2. check if it has a (@).
  3. check if it has a (gmail).
  4. check if it has a (.com).
3. it helps find what is missed in your gmail.
4. it helps you find a good password

## Upcoming featuers ^-^ 
I am working on more options to make the page greater as like:
1. a generator for a password
2. autocompelete for the gmail
3. sign-in page tests if the (account) is valid

**Have Trying it** ðŸš€
